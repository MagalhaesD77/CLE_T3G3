 *
 *  Synchronization based on monitors.
 *  Both threads and the monitor are implemented using the pthread library which enables the creation of a
 *  monitor of the Lampson / Redell type.
 *
 *  Data transfer region implemented as a monitor.
 *
 *  Definition of the operations carried out by the distributor / workers:
 *     \li read file
 *     \li defineSubSequences
 *     \li distributeWorkloads
 *     \li askForWorkloads
